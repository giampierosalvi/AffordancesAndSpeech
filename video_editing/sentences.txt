In this video we present a study on learning associations between spoken words and object-affordances.
We use Baltazar, a humanoid robot with fourteen degrees of freedom, vision and tactile sensors. The robot can perform some actions on objects.
Baltazar's playground is composed of simple objects, with several shapes, sizes and colors.
Initially, nothing is known about objects. What distingushes them? How do they respond to actions?
Baltazar interacts with objects and collects information about their properties and behaviour to actions.
Along time, it clusters its sensory perceptions into meaninful groups, and forms symbolic descriptions of objects properties and the effects of actions.
After gaining some knowledge about individual object and effect properties, the robot learns to associate the features of objects to the consequences (effects) of its actions, thus creating a model of object affordances.
In this video the robot is applying a grasp action to a big orange ball.
It realizes that the effect consists of persistent hand-object contact, medium displacement, small relative hand-to-object displacement.
Here the robot taps two different objects.
It realizes that the effects depend on some properties such as shape, but not on others, such as color.
This is a graphical illustration of the dependencies the robot has found.
While listening to spoken descriptions of the task provided by humans, the robot can learn to associate words to perceptions and actions by exploiting their co-occurrence.
After a training stage, the robot has learned the following word-to-meaning associations.
This is a complete illustration of the dependencies found by the robot.
White nodes correspond to words, gray nodes to meaninings.
We can split the complete models in parts to simplify the illustration.
Object properties are clearly associated with the correspoinding words.
Actions are also associated with the corresponding verbs.
Words describing effects are associated with a combination of nodes that represent that effect.
Given a verbal instruction that is possibly ambiguous or incomplete, the environment configuration toghether with the learned models will enable the robot to choose the appropriate action and object to operate.
