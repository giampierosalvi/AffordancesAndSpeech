### Illustration of the experiments reproduced with the iCub
The experiments in the paper were performed with the Baltazar robotic platform. The following video shows the same experiments performed on the iCub.

## Data
The speech data used in the paper can be downloaded here:

The ASR code will be added to this repository after cleaning up.

## Changes
The code has been updated in November 2017 to support new studies. The main difference are:
* support for soft evidence
* code to generate written descriptions of experiments according to a formal grammar given a probability distribution of words estimated by the affordance-word model.

The code should be backward compatible to the 2012 experiment.

## Contents
`bayesian_net`:
code to train and test a Bayesian network with affordance and word nodes. The main script is `README.m`. The script uses as input a number of bag-of-words text files obtained from the the ASR code that is not included at the moment.

`word2sent`:
definition of the context-free formal grammar to generate sentences from probability distribution over words.
